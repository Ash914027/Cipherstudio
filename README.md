# 🚀 CipherStudio - Your Browser-Based React IDE

## 🎯 Objective
Build a browser-based React IDE called **CipherStudio** where users can:
- ✨ Create and manage multiple files for a React project.
- 📝 Write React code directly in the browser.
- 🔄 Run and preview their project live as they code.
- 💾 Save and reload their projects to continue later.

The goal is to simulate a real online development environment similar to platforms like NextLeap.js or CodeSandbox, while testing your full-stack design thinking, frontend skills, and integration ability.

## 🛠️ Features to Implement

### Core Features (Required):
- 📁 **File Management:** Users can create, delete, and organize project files.
- 🖥️ **Code Editor:** A rich code editor for writing React components (consider using Monaco Editor or Sandpack).
- 🌟 **Live Preview:** Display the React project output in real-time as the code changes.
- 💾 **Save & Load Projects:** Users can save their project state and reload it later from `localStorage` with the help of `projectId`.
- 🎨 **UI/UX:** A clean and intuitive interface for a seamless user experience.
